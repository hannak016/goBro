## Game intro
When the first player creates a new game, the game room will be randomly assigned an ID. You then join the game room with it.
The sun timer would begin to fall down after both players' entrance. The game terminates when the sun disappears behind the mountain. No one wins in this case. Otherwise the one who attacks their opponent's health down to zero, wins.
